Git and GitHub

Summary

Git is a version source control tool by which u can manage a projects source code history.
GitHub is a cloud based platform built around the Git tool as an online service that stores 
code pushed to it from computers running the Git tool.

Git is focused on version control and code sharing
GitHub is focused on centralized source code hosting.

Git is open source licensed
GitHub has free tiers and paid tiers

Git is primarily a command line tool
GitHub is administered through the web.

Key terminology

-	Repository
  The Repository or 'Repo'is like a directory (database) that stores all the files,
  folder and content needed for your project. Repositories can be shared and copied.
  
-	Main / Master
  Main: the primary branch of all repositories. All committed and accepted changes should 
  be on the master branch.
  
-	Branch
  Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository.
  ou always create a branch from an existing branch. Typically, you might create a new branch from the default branch of your 
  repository. You can then work on this new branch in isolation from changes that other people are making to the repository.
  You can merge a branch into another branch using a pull request.
  
-	Commit
  Similar to saving a file that's been edited, a commit records changes to one or more files in your branch. 
  Git assigns each commit a unique ID, called a SHA or hash, that identifies:
  The specific changes
  When the changes were made
  Who created the changes
  When you make a commit, you must include a commit message that briefly describes the changes.
  
-	Push / Pull

  Push:Pushing changes to GitHub. As you commit changes to your project locally, you can push those changes to GitHub so that others 
  may access them from the remote repository. When you push changes, you send the committed changes in your local repository to the
  remote repository on GitHub. If you change your project locally and want other people to have access to the changes, you must push
  the changes to GitHub. 
  Before pushing changes, you should update your local branch to include any commits that have been added to the remote repository.

  Pull: Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request
  is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes 
  are merged into the base branch.
  
-	Merge
  ou can allow contributors with push access to your repository to merge their pull requests on GitHub.com with different merge options
  or enforce a specific merge method for all of your repository's pull requests.You can enforce one type of merge method, such as commit
  squashing or rebasing, by only enabling the desired method for your repository.
  
-	Fork
  A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
  Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project to which you do not have write access, or to use someone 
  else's project as a starting point for your own idea. You can fork a repository to create a copy of the repository and make changes without
  affecting the upstream repository.

Overcome challenges
Personally, for me, all material and applications we work with are new. So the challenge is to know what is the application for, what does it do 
and how do I use it. So for me, the understanding is important.
Also, I lost a afternoon because of laptop problems, luckily I had already asked Yasmina for a laptop which I could use during the course.
Some people speak to much or hold on too long on a subject, its a challenge to attend them in a nice manner to that.
