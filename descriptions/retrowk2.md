# [Group Cloudzakken] Retro of Week [2]
Scrum master: Give everybody 10 minutes to answer the questions stated below. Then allow them to write them down.

Everybody: Use 10 minutes to answer the given questions. Write the answer down.

Afterwards: Place a copy of this filled out form in your repository.

## What went well?
 - The group can communicate which each other.
 - Everyone is able to give their opinion.

## What could have gone better?
 - I lost again some valuable time, because of a long job interview.
 - Secondly a crash of my laptop, which caused me to do excercise 4 and 5 again. Also it was somehow not in my Github, that day. Lost half a day of it.
- When the people who go faster than others are too far ahead, I think the people who are behind are not able to ask questions or hints. Because at the end of the day they are not online anymore.

## What can we do to improve?
 - The cooperation between fast and slower students.
