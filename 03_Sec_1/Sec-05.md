## Asymmetric encryption

What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?

Symmetric encryption uses a private key to encrypt and decrypt an encrypted email.
Asymmetric encryption uses the public key of the recipient to encrypt the message. Then if the recipient wants to decrypt the message the recipient will have to use his/her private key to decrypt. If the keys correspond then the message is decrypted.
