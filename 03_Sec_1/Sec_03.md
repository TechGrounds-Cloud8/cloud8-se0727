## Identity and Access Management

Identity Authentication â€“ Are They Who They Say They Are?

 How do you know a person is who they say they are? As the online world evolves, the need for verifiable and trusted identities increases. 

 Personal Identifiable Information (PII):

* Identity authentication -- requires an identity check to confirm that the person actually exists
* Identity validation -- checking the validity of the identity data they provide
* Identity verification -- verifying that data

The identity journey starts at verification; does a record of this person exist? When a person supplies their identifying information such as name, address and date of birth, does that information match a record of a person? 
Identity validation checks if the information represents real data. While the identity information might match a record, without validation a record with inaccurate of fraudulent data would seem legitimate.
Identity authentication determines if the person is who they say they are. Authentication relies on additional data that is difficult to produce, except by that specific person.

Traditionally, this level of identity data relied on Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA), which uses questions that (supposedly) only that person knows. For example, Mothers maiden name or name of your first pet are common KBA questions. Biometrics offers another authentication process. Using the uniqueness of a human characteristics, such as a fingerprint, retina, face or voice, biometrics provides identity information about something you are.

#### Multi Factor Authentication

An authentication system that requires more than one distinct authentication factor for successful authentication. Multi-factor authentication can be performed using a multi-factor authenticator or by a combination of authenticators that provide different factors. The three authentication factors are:
* something you know (e.g., password/PIN)
* something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token)
* something you are (e.g., biometric).

How does Multi-factor authentication improve security?

* adds layers of security at the hardware, software and personal ID levels;
* can use OTPs sent to phones that are randomly generated in real time and is difficult for hackers to break;
* enables businesses to opt to restrict access for time of day or location
* 

#### Priciple of least privilege for authorization (PoLP)

The principle that users, systems and processes should only be given access (only have the necessary privileges) to the networks, data and other resources required to perform their assigned function / to complete their task.

How does the priciple of least privilege improve security?

* Reduce the attack surface. By limiting access to resources to just those that are required by each user for their specific function, cybercriminals that take over accounts will be kept from accessing all resources.
* Limit the spread of malware. Malware often requires privileged access to infect systems, and without that access, a widespread attack is thwarted.
* Increase accountability. By limiting permissions, you can more easily keep track of the users and systems with access to sensitive data, networks and other resources.
* Improve performance and the user experience. Keeping unnecessary users out of systems and resources increases productivity for the users that do need access and reduces confusion for those that don't.
