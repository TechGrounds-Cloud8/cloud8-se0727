## IP adressen

* IP address
An IP address is a numeric address: it is an identifier for a computer or device on a network. Every device has to have an IP address for communication purposes.

* Public en Private IPs
There are two different types of IP addresses:
        * Public
        * Private

Public IP address: when u want a connection to the Internet, yu will need a internet service provider. They will assign a modem/router in your place with a public IP address.
* This public IP address is what's registered on the internet and gives you access to the world wide web (Internet). IF u do not have a public IP address, u cannot access the Internet.
* Public IP addresses are unique (there are no duplicates in the world)

When the IPv4 addresses were created the engineers did not realise how big the internet would become. Although there are over 4 billion IP version 4 addresses available, du eto th eexplosive growth of the Internet they almost are running up. So in order to prevent a shortage of IP4 addresses engineers developed Private IP addresses.

Private IP address: These are not publicly registered on the Internet.
* So u cannot access the Internet using a Private IP address.
* When u have a device with a Private IP address and u wish to access the Internet, this Private IP address has to be converted to a Public IP address.
* Private IP addresses are only used internally, (home or business).
The DHCP server (service) inside your Router is what assigns your internal devices a Private IP.
A home or business has multiple devices with their own Private IP adresses that need access to the Internet. These Private IP addresses will be translated to the one Public that we have been given by the ISP.
