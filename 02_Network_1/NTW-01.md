# NTW-01  OSI Stack

OSI stands for Open System Interconnection Model.

The OSI model was made for connecting open systems. These systems are created/designed to be open for communication with almost any other system.

The OSI model defines internetworking in terms of a vertical stack of seven layers to explain the flow of information. The OSI model can be used as a guide for how data is transmitted over the network (an abstract representation of the data pathway).

The upper layers of the OSI model represent software that implements network services like encryption and connection management. 
The lower layers of the OSI model implement hardware-oriented functions like routing, addressing, and flow control.
