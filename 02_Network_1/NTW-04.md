## Counting in Binary and Hex

Binary
Binary follows the same pattern as Decimal except that instead of being base 10, it is instead base 2. Instead of having 10 symbols to represent values we have two ( 0 and 1 ).

So Decimal is a base 10 number system, we have 10 symbols and multiply by powers of 10. It follows that Binary is a base 2 number system, we have two symbols and multiply by powers of 2.

Let's look at an example:

If I have the binary number 101010, this translates into decimal as:

32 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 42

Or:


1 * 2^5 25 |	32

0 * 24 | 	0
1 * 23	8
0 * 22	0
1 * 21	2
0 * 20	0

As you can see from this example, binary is not as convenient as decimal for humans to read and work with. So you may be asking, Why bother with binary then? The answer is that it is an easier format for computers to work with. It may also be utilised in other areas as a shortcut to represent settings.
